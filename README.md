# Rail Cipher Program

This program implements the **Rail Cipher**, a transposition cipher where a message is arranged in multiple rows (rails), and then the message is read off in a specific order. The program allows the user to choose between encryption and decryption, input their message, and encrypt or decrypt using the Rail Cipher method with a fixed key of 3 rails.

## Features

- **Rail Cipher**: Encrypts and decrypts messages by arranging characters into multiple rows (rails) and reading them in a specific order.
- **Fixed Key**: This cipher uses a fixed key of 3 rails for encryption and decryption.
